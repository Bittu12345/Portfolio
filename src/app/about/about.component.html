      </div>
      <p>I've a Master's and Bachelor degree in Computer science and have professional experience of around 2 years in
        the working with <b>Java</b>, <b>C#</b>.
        Having worked in an agile-environment, I really like building new stuff and working with other people â€“ nothing
        really interesting is ever built alone!.

        I always strive forward to learn some new technologies. I'm looking to harness my skills which I already posess
        and
        take them to another level through out my career in this software field.

          Besides programming, I'm mostly interested in playing sports, both indoor and outdoor, but slighthy inclined
          towards outdoor
          games, Especially sports called 'cricket' famous back in my home country.
          I also spend time playing console games, particularly open world games, which doesn't tie you to explore
          yourself.
