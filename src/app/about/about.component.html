          <p>I was born in 1996. I'm a Graduate student, with Master's degree in Computer science. 
            I've worked on several languages including Java, C# , Python for my individual projects as well as course projects.
            I like building new stuff and work with other people â€“ nothing really interesting is ever built alone!
            I mainly beleive, logical thinking is thing which solves the complex problems, and programming language is just a tool.
            I always strive forward to learn something new. And that's the reason you see bunch of languages in my Resume.
            To start a fresh language, knowing the fundementals of the language is very importent. If you have a strong foundation,
            you can do build upon it, that's what I learnt from my experience of learning the new languages.

             Besides programming,I'm mostly interested in playing sports, both indoor and outdoor, but slighthy inclined towards outdoor
             games, Especially sports called 'cricket' famous back in my home country.
             I also spend time playing console games, particularly open world games, which doesn't tie you to explore yourself.
